2. **AI Integration**: Integrates Puter's AI capabilities (`puter.ai`) to generate content, improve existing articles, and create summaries

3. **Authentication**: Secures your knowledge base with Puter's authentication system

4. **File System**: Organizes attachments and exports using Puter's file system
